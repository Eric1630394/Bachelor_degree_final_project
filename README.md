# Content stored in this repository
Hey!! 👋

Let me introduce the content inside this repository. I am Eric Garcia, an undergraduate student of the Genetic's degree at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB) 🏛️. This year, as I face the completion of my studies, I am elaborating my bachelor's degree final project. 

My reserach has been focused in studying association between alleles of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and Structurals Variants (SVs), specifically inversions. With this objective in mind, I created a collection of shell 🐚 and R 📊 scripts to run my analyses and automatize the treatment of big-data datasets. 

This repository has been divided in different folders 📁 (introduced here) depending on the material used in every phase. In each folder one can find the code itself and other files passed to the scripts or generated from them. 

## 📁 Input files

This directory contains all the files that are passed to the different scripts (stored in the other two folders), necessary to generate the results. These input data refers to:
| Input file | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|invappend2_v2.in|
|Inversions_coordinates_porubsky_v3.csv|
|Genotyping_info.txt|
|United3.ld|
