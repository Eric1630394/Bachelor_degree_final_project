# Content stored in this repository
Hey!! :wave:
Let me introduce the content isnide this repository. I am Eric Garcia, an undergraduate of the Genetic's degree at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). This year, as I face the completion of my studies, I am elaborating the bachelor's degree final project. My reserach has been focused in studying association between alleles of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and Structurals Variants (SVs), specifically inversions. With this objective in mind, I created some bash and R scripts to run my analyses and that way automatizing the treatment of a great amount of data. 
So, this repository has been divided in different folders (intridced here) depending on the material used in every phase. In each folder one can find input data, the code itself and output data.
